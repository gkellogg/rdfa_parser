=== 0.0.4 2009-10-18
* Fixed namespace bug in RDF/XML generation from Graph
* Fixed URI generation from namespace, which failed when suffix was a defined method of Namespace (use ns + suffix)

=== 0.0.3 2009-10-12
* Added --quiet option to executable
* BNode RDF/XML output
* Output all default namespaces in RDF/XML
=== 0.0.2 2009-10-10
* Switch to jeweler from newgem/hoe
* RdfaParser.new just creates parser, allowing a different graph to be substituted.
* parser.parse() performs parse.
* Added Graph.to_rdfxml to output graph in XML serialization

=== 0.0.1 2009-09-26

* Previous versions based on original work by Ben Adida.
* Spec tests use Redland/Rasqal to check results.
  * Version 0.9.16 of Rasqal does not support UNION, so those tests are compared against NTriples
* Passes most XHTML+RDFa tests. Of those that don't pass:
  * NTriple BNode production differences.
  * XMLLiteral attribute/namespace ordering differences (requires deep XML compare, not in Nokogiri).
* Unexplained failures:
  * Test0102: XMLLiteral with explicit namespace and xml:lang; not overwriting existing langs
  * Test0103: XMLLiteral with explicit namespace; not overwriting local namespaces
  * Test0105: inner @rel neither CURIE nor LinkType
  * Test0106: chaining with empty value in inner @rel
  * Test0121: "[]" is a valid safe CURIE
    * RDFa parser seems to be working correctly, but Nokogiri parses embedded <p> incorrectly
