=== 0.0.5 2009-10-17
* Fixed generation of RDF/XML for XML Literals.
* Update Specs for style
* Add eql? and hash methods to BNode and URIRef to allow for uniq
* Added test based on 0017 to find BNode XML output problems.
* Allow empty BNodes to be considered to be named
* Add xml:lang to XMLLiterals as necessary
* Don't add existing namespace definition to XML Literal
* Special output for XML Literal to treat xml:lang within string. Add on create.
* Added Namespace#xmlns_hash
* Use XML Parser, not HTML (this should probably vary on doc type). HTML parser was removing namespace declarations from XMLLiterals.
* Added _profile_ option to RdfaParser#parse to set parsetype to xhtml1, html4, or html5. Right now only xhtml1 is used.
* Use to_html when re-serializing XMLLiterals, whitespace was being destroid otherwise.
* All specs pass!

=== 0.0.4 2009-10-16
* Fixed namespace bug in RDF/XML generation from Graph
* Fixed URI generation from namespace, which failed when suffix was a defined method of Namespace (use ns + suffix)

=== 0.0.3 2009-10-12
* Added --quiet option to executable
* BNode RDF/XML output
* Output all default namespaces in RDF/XML
=== 0.0.2 2009-10-10
* Switch to jeweler from newgem/hoe
* RdfaParser.new just creates parser, allowing a different graph to be substituted.
* parser.parse() performs parse.
* Added Graph.to_rdfxml to output graph in XML serialization

=== 0.0.1 2009-09-26

* Previous versions based on original work by Ben Adida.
* Spec tests use Redland/Rasqal to check results.
  * Version 0.9.16 of Rasqal does not support UNION, so those tests are compared against NTriples
* Passes most XHTML+RDFa tests. Of those that don't pass:
  * NTriple BNode production differences.
  * XMLLiteral attribute/namespace ordering differences (requires deep XML compare, not in Nokogiri).
* Unexplained failures:
  * Test0102: XMLLiteral with explicit namespace and xml:lang; not overwriting existing langs
  * Test0103: XMLLiteral with explicit namespace; not overwriting local namespaces
  * Test0105: inner @rel neither CURIE nor LinkType
  * Test0106: chaining with empty value in inner @rel
  * Test0121: "[]" is a valid safe CURIE
    * RDFa parser seems to be working correctly, but Nokogiri parses embedded <p> incorrectly
